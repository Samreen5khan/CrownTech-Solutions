        <b>"WHY?"</b>
        <em>Why did we start working towards this idea?</em>
      </h1>

      <p>
        The hurdles faced my the students is the inspiration of this idea. There are a lot of companies offering trainnings and internships, with a team of experts. Then what makes us stand apart from them.
